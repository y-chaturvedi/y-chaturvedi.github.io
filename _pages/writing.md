At the age of six, my interest in writing came to the fore when I wrote far more limericks than we were asked to write in school. I then wrote for school magazines, class plays and brochures, before I started to write for myself in middle school.

In January 2021, I launched <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepurplepapyrus/">The Purple Papyrus | Instagram</a>, my writing account on Instagram. In the same year, I took upon a new challenge and completed <a href="https://inktober.com/">Inktober</a>. Last year, my poem "I Don't Know My Way To College" was published in the 54th edition of Georgia Tech's <a href="https://erato.gtorg.gatech.edu/2023-2024-edition/">Erato</a> magazine.

I thoroughly enjoy writing prompts, collaborations and challenges. Reach out if you'd like to discuss my work or collaborations!
