While journalism for me began as an extension of my interest in writing, it has evolved into something far more than self-expression. My first article for BITS Goa's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dojma_bitsgoa/">Department of Journalism and Media Affairs (DoJMA)</a> was about the unique scientific phenomena that gave rise to the exquisite sunset skies in Goa. As a part of DoJMA, I interviewed celebrities such as automotive designer Dilip Chhabria, DJ Nucleya and paralympian Devendra Jhajhariya. In my third year, I served as the Sports Editor of the newspaper.

During the lockdown, I had the opportunity to explore freelance journalism. I channelled my interest and keen following of cricket into consistent writing for <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/">Sportskeeda</a>, a global sports and entertainment platform. As of today, I have written over 200 features on the platform which have been read by over 900K viewers. You can find my author page here: <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/author/yash-chaturvedi-1692s">Yash Chaturvedi | Sportskeeda</a>.

When I began my Masters at Georgia Tech, I gravitated towards the stall for the <a href="https://nique.net/">Technique</a> at the org fair. Founded in 1911, the newspaper's rich legacy gave me high standards to uphold and lots to learn on the job. Through the Technique, I have learnt and spread the word about student activism on campus, Tech traditions, new launches in the world of entertainment and local politics, among other issues. I have written for the News, Life, Sport and Entertainment sections of the Technique. You can find my writer page here: <a href="https://nique.net/author/yash-chaturvedi/">Yash Chaturvedi | Technique</a>.

On occasion, I have also found myself on the other side of the microphone. A day before the 2024 US Election result came out, I spoke to Shashank Mattoo at India Today Global at length about the immigration experience for Indian students and what each candidate promised to this demographic. You can watch the interview here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oaq6T8B9Cv0">Will The U.S. Election Impact Your America Study Plans? Indian Student In America Answers | YouTube</a>. I have also been featured in the <a href="https://www.emorywheel.com/article/2023/10/students-journalists-connect-at-asian-american-journalists-association-panel">Emory Wheel</a> and <a href="https://speculatorvision.wordpress.com/2024/04/28/the-buzz-around-the-buzz-studios-film-festival/">The Speculator</a>.

I was also a student member of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aajaatlanta/">Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA) Atlanta chapter</a>. Drop me a mail to discuss journalism!
