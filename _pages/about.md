<mark><b>I am looking for software engineering, research and/or cryptography related full-time positions starting May 2025.</b></mark>

Hello there! I'm a second-year MS CS student at Georgia Tech specializing in Computing Systems.

I am currently a researcher at Georgia Tech's School of Cybersecurity and Privacy in the CSAFA lab under <a href="https://research.gatech.edu/people/j-sukarno-mertoguno">Dr. Sukarno Mertoguno</a>. Before I joined Georgia Tech, I was a full-stack software engineer at Adobe India for two years, working primarily on the Adobe Sign product.

My current research centers around the following areas:

- Identifying vulnerabilities in the way LLMs are used to generate code. Keywords: LLM, SQL, cryptography, PowerShell, code generation
- Improving the memory and type safety of C to Rust code conversion. Keywords: C, Rust, BASH, C2Rust, compilers

My other areas of interest include blockchain networks, cryptography and privacy. I enjoy working on technological solutions to improving user privacy - such as blockchain networks for low-power devices, digital identity authentication and safe user data migration upon account transfer.

My top skills are React, Spring Boot (Java) and JavaScript. You can read more about my projects, experience and skills in the [CV](/cv/) section.

Since the third year of my undergrad, I have served as a Teaching Assistant in various courses. In Fall 2024, I was selected to serve as the Head Teaching Assistant of CS 3001: Computing, Society and Professionalism. You can read about my experience as a Teaching Assistant over the years in the [Teaching](/teaching/) section.

Outside of academics, I have invested my time in three major extra-curricular activities:

- [Debating](/debating/): I represented my school and university at close to 100 debate tournaments. The activity transformed my general knowledge, communication skills and self-confidence.
- [Journalism](/journalism/): I have been a reporter, writer and editor for my undergrad and grad university's newspaper, as well as for Sportskeeda, a global sports platform. Journalism has helped me sharpen my written communication, ask better questions and understand the challenges faced by news media today.
- [Writing](/writing/): I have honed my creative writing from the time I was in primary school. Writing has helped me with self-expression, pushing the bounds of my imagination and stress relief.

I also enjoy cooking, photography, cricket and 8-ball pool. Let's talk!
