Hello there! I'm a second-year MS CS student at Georgia Tech specializing in Computing Systems. I am looking for software engineering, research and/or cryptography related full-time positions starting May 2025.

I'm a researcher at Georgia Tech's School of Cybersecurity and Privacy in the CSAFA lab under <a href="https://research.gatech.edu/people/j-sukarno-mertoguno">Dr. Sukarno Mertoguno</a>. My current research centers around the following areas:

- Improving the memory and type safety of C to Rust code conversion
- Identifying vulnerabilities in the way LLMs are used to generate code

My areas of interest include: programming language security, LLM vulnerabilities, blockchain networks, cryptography and number theory.

Before I joined Georgia Tech, I was a full-stack software engineer at Adobe India for two years, working primarily on the Adobe Sign product. My top skills are React, Spring Boot (Java) and JavaScript. You can read more about my experience and skills in the CV section.

I have a number of parallel pursuits, some of which I have dedicated years (and pages on this website) to! I also enjoy cooking, photography, cricket and 8-ball pool.
