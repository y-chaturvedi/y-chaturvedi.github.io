Hello there! I'm a researcher at Georgia Tech's School of Cybersecurity and Privacy under <a href="https://research.gatech.edu/people/j-sukarno-mertoguno">Dr. Sukarno Mertoguno</a>. I'm an MS CS student specializing in Computing Systems.

My areas of interest include: programming language security, LLM vulnerabilities, blockchain networks, cryptography and number theory.

Before I joined Georgia Tech, I was a software engineer at Adobe India, working primarily on the Adobe Sign product. You can read more about my experience and skills in the CV section.
