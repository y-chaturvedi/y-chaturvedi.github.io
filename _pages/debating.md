description: Parliamentary Debating Experience
---

Parliamentary debating has been a highly rewarding time investment of mine. I tried out the activity for the first time at the age of 16 at the NLS Debate Junior. Our team's unexpected trophy win in that tournament catapulted me on an unforgettable journey that has allowed me to explore various parts of India and the world while representing BITS Goa.

I have been involved with the <a href="https://indianschoolsdebatingsociety.com/">Indian Schools Debating Society</a> in various capacities - helping pick the national team in 2020, coaching a team for an international schools competition in 2021 and training a WSDC developmental squad in 2022.

While I stepped away from competitive debating in 2023, I am always happy to share my knowledge and practical experience. Please have a look at my debating CV and drop me a mail to discuss any queries you might have.
